ml4pers: Machine Learning for Persistence
============================================================

You're on the associated page for our repository for our paper, `A Comparative Study of Machine Learning Methods for Persistence Diagrams <https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frai.2021.681174/full?&utm_source=Email_to_authors_&utm_medium=Email&utm_content=T1_11.5e1_author&utm_campaign=Email_publication&field=&journalName=Frontiers_in_Artificial_Intelligence&id=681174>`_.

Soon this code will be available as a python package, with additional documentation and examples.  Note there are many packages that have similar or the same types of functions - the goal of this package is to provide datasets and precomputed persistence diagrams with some examples of how to build machine learning models from the persistence diagrams.  This may at some point be
merged with another package.
